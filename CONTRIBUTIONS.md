## Local Development Setup

This section is the **single source of truth** for getting CodeFlowViz 2.0 running on your own machine. Follow each step in order.

### Repository Layout

```text
CodeFlowViz-2.0/
├── frontend/        # Next.js 14 cockpit UI  →  http://localhost:3000
├── backend/         # Express + AST engine   →  http://localhost:4000
└── package.json     # Root npm workspace (manages both)
```

---

### Step 0 — Prerequisites

Make sure the following tools are installed **before** you begin:

| Tool        | Minimum version            | Download              |
| ----------- | -------------------------- | --------------------- |
| **Node.js** | v18 (v20+ recommended)     | <https://nodejs.org>  |
| **npm**     | v9+ (bundled with Node.js) | —                     |
| **Git**     | any recent version         | <https://git-scm.com> |

Verify your versions:

```bash
node -v   # should print v18.x.x or higher
npm -v    # should print 9.x.x or higher
git -v
```

---

### Step 1 — Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/<your-org>/CodeFlowViz-2.0.git
cd "CodeFlowViz-2.0"
```

---

### Step 2 — Install dependencies

Run a **single command from the repo root**. npm workspaces automatically installs packages for both `frontend/` and `backend/`:

```bash
npm install
```

What gets installed:

| Workspace   | Key packages                                                                    |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `frontend/` | `next@14`, `react`, `react-dom`, `@monaco-editor/react`, `typescript`, `eslint` |
| `backend/`  | `express`, `acorn`                                                              |

> **Tip:** If you ever need to install packages for just one workspace, use:
>
> ```bash
> npm install --workspace frontend
> npm install --workspace backend
> ```

---

### Step 3 — Create environment files

The frontend automatically proxies execution requests to
`http://127.0.0.1:4000/api/execute` during local development. Create
`frontend/.env.local` only when your backend uses a different URL.

#### 3a. Frontend — `frontend/.env.local`

This tells the Next.js server proxy where to send code-execution requests:

**macOS / Linux / Git Bash:**

```bash
echo 'EXECUTE_API_URL=http://localhost:4000/api/execute' > frontend/.env.local
```

**Windows (PowerShell):**

```powershell
Set-Content frontend\.env.local 'EXECUTE_API_URL=http://localhost:4000/api/execute'
```

Or simply create the file manually in your editor with the content:

```env
EXECUTE_API_URL=http://localhost:4000/api/execute
```

#### 3b. Backend — `backend/.env`

This configures the Express server port and CORS policy:

**macOS / Linux / Git Bash:**

```bash
printf 'PORT=4000\nCORS_ORIGIN=http://localhost:3000\n' > backend/.env
```

**Windows (PowerShell):**

```powershell
Set-Content backend\.env "PORT=4000`nCORS_ORIGIN=http://localhost:3000"
```

Or create manually with content:

```env
PORT=4000
CORS_ORIGIN=http://localhost:3000
```

> **Note:** If you skip `backend/.env`, the backend falls back to `PORT=4000` and `CORS_ORIGIN=*`. The `*` wildcard is fine for local use but never deploy with it.

---

### Dummy environment variables (quick-start bypass)

If you hit errors on first run because of missing variables, copy-paste the values below — they are safe placeholders that satisfy every validation check during local development.

**`frontend/.env.local`**

```env
EXECUTE_API_URL=http://localhost:4000/api/execute
```

**`backend/.env`**

```env
PORT=4000
CORS_ORIGIN=http://localhost:3000
```

---

### Step 4 — Start the development servers

#### Option A — start both with one command (recommended)

From the repo root:

```bash
npm run dev
```

This runs `npm run dev:backend` and `npm run dev:frontend` concurrently.

#### Option B — start each server in its own terminal

**Terminal 1** (Next.js frontend — hot-reload enabled):

```bash
npm run dev:frontend
```

**Terminal 2** (Node.js backend — file-watch restart via `--watch`):

```bash
npm run dev:backend
```

#### Available npm scripts (root workspace)

| Script                   | What it does                                   |
| ------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------- |
| `npm run dev`            | Starts both servers concurrently               |
| `npm run dev:frontend`   | `next dev` inside `frontend/`                  |
| `npm run dev:backend`    | `node --watch src/server.js` inside `backend/` |
| `npm run build`          | Production build of the Next.js frontend       |
| `npm run start:frontend` | Serves the production Next.js build            |
| `npm run start:backend`  | Starts the backend without file-watch          |
| `npm run lint`           | Runs ESLint on the frontend                    |

---

### Step 5 — Verify everything is running

| Check          | URL                            | Expected                                           |
| -------------- | ------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------- |
| Frontend       | <http://localhost:3000>        | CodeFlowViz cockpit loads in the browser           |
| Backend health | <http://localhost:4000/health> | `{ "ok": true, "service": "codeflowviz-backend" }` |

Quick health-check via CLI:

```bash
curl http://localhost:4000/health
```

---

### Step 6 — Production build (optional)

To compile the Next.js frontend into a production bundle:

```bash
npm run build          # builds frontend/
npm run start:frontend # serves the built bundle
```

To run the backend without the file-watcher:

```bash
npm run start:backend
```

### Troubleshooting

| Symptom                              | Fix                                                                                                                                                                   |
| ------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `npm install` fails                  | Check `node -v` ≥ 18 and `npm -v` ≥ 9; reinstall Node.js if needed                                                                                                    |
| Frontend reports an unreachable backend | Confirm the backend is running and `EXECUTE_API_URL` points to its `/api/execute` endpoint                                                                        |
| Port 4000 already in use             | Change `PORT` in `backend/.env` and update `EXECUTE_API_URL` to match                                                                                                 |
| Backend starts but returns no traces | Check backend terminal for parser errors; test directly: `curl -X POST http://localhost:4000/api/execute -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d "{\"code\":\"1+1\"}"` |
| `next: command not found`            | Run `npm install` from the repo root (not inside `frontend/`)                                                                                                         |

## Deployment

### API Contract (frontend ↔ backend)

The frontend posts source code to the backend execution endpoint:

- **Method:** `POST`
- **Endpoint:** `/api/execute`
- **Content-Type:** `application/json`

Example payload:

```json
{
  "code": "function add(a,b){return a+b}; add(2,3);"
}
```

The backend responds with trace telemetry consumed by the timeline and variable inspector panels.

### Frontend on Vercel

1. Import the repository into Vercel.
2. Set the project root to `frontend/`.
3. Add the server-only `EXECUTE_API_URL` environment variable with the deployed
   backend `/api/execute` URL.
4. Deploy.

### Backend on Railway

1. Create a Railway service from the same repository.
2. Set the service root to `backend/`.
3. Add `PORT` if required by your Railway configuration.
4. Add `CORS_ORIGIN` with the Vercel frontend URL.
5. Deploy the Express service.

### Post-deployment checklist

1. Open the deployed frontend URL and run a simple snippet (`const x = 1 + 1`) to verify trace rendering.
2. Confirm backend health is reachable from the public host: `GET /health`.
3. Confirm the same-origin frontend `/api/execute` proxy reaches the backend.
4. Verify backend logs show execution steps and no worker-thread crashes.

## Troubleshooting

- **Execution backend is not configured**: Add `EXECUTE_API_URL` to the Vercel
  project and redeploy. It must be the public backend `/api/execute` URL.
- **Execution backend is unreachable**: Confirm the backend health endpoint is
  public and `EXECUTE_API_URL` uses the correct HTTPS hostname and path.
- **Port binding failures on Railway**: Confirm the service uses Railway-provided `PORT` and does not hardcode `4000` in production.
- **No trace events returned**: Inspect backend logs for parser/runtime errors; test the same snippet directly against the API with `curl`.

## Note: For running in windows
- Install concurrently package as a development dependency.
- Run this in the root of the project:

```bash
npm install concurrently --save-dev
```

## Roadmap

- **Multi-language execution** — Python and C++ tracing after the JavaScript execution path is hardened.
- **Advanced Logic Node overlays** — Higher-level control-flow nodes rendered above raw trace events.
- **Trace sharing** — Exportable sessions for code reviews, incident analysis, and teaching.
- **Custom cockpit layouts** — Persisted panels for architecture reviews, demos, and debugging workflows.
- **Expanded sandbox policies** — More granular limits for memory, execution time, and API access.
